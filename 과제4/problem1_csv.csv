Keywords,Definition
HTTP,"http?is an?application-layer?protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical?client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a?stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests."
Host,The HTTP host header is a request header that specifies
Port,"In?computer networking, a?port?is a communication endpoint. At the software level, within an?operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific?process?or a type of?network service. A port is identified for each?transport protocol?and address combination by a 16-bit?unsigned number, known as the?port number. The most common transport protocols that use port numbers are the?Transmission Control Protocol?(TCP) and the?User Datagram Protocol?(UDP)."
Encryption,"encryption?is the process of?encoding?information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as?plaintext, into an alternative form known as?ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor."
Caching,a?cache?(/k©¡?/?(listen)?KASH)[1]?is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.
Cookies,"HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user's web browser. Cookies are placed on the device used to access a website, and more than one cookie may be placed on a user's device during a session."
Session,"a?session?is a time-delimited two-way link, a practical (relatively high) layer in the?tcp/ip protocol?enabling interactive expression and information exchange between two or more communication devices or ends ? be they computers, automated systems, or live active users (see?login session).?"
WSGI,"he?Web Server Gateway Interface?(WSGI, pronounced?whiskey[1][2]?or?WIZ-ghee[3]) is a simple?calling convention?for?web servers?to forward requests to?web applications?or?frameworks?written in the?Python programming language. The current version of WSGI, version 1.0.1, is specified in?Python Enhancement Proposal?(PEP) 3333.[4]"
Gunicorn,"he?Gunicorn?""Green Unicorn"" (pronounced jee-unicorn or gun-i-corn)[2]?is a?Python?Web Server Gateway Interface?(WSGI)?HTTP server. It is a pre-fork?worker model,?ported?from?Ruby's?Unicorn?project. The Gunicorn server is broadly compatible with a number of?web frameworks, simply implemented, light on server resources and fairly fast.[3]?It is often paired with?NGINX, as the two have complementary features.[4]"
Apache,"The?Apache HTTP Server?(/??p©¡t?i/??-PATCH-ee) is a free and open-source cross-platform?web server?software, released under the terms of Apache License 2.0. Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the?Apache Software Foundation."
